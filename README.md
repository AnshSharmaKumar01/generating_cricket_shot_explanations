### Generating Explanations of Cricket Shot Technqiues

This repository contains all the code that I used the final version of my Research Project

The code consists of every module that was needed to create the final prototypes seen in the report. To create a new prototype, follow the following instructions:

* Add the video you want to create a prototype for in sample_videos. The videos are split into two groups, ideal_videos (with ideal forms), and practice_videos (for the shots that are to be analyzed).
* In the config.py file add the video name and the target frame to TARGET_FRAME_MAP.
* Make changes to the configuration, to get whatever prototype you want.
* Run main.py to generate the prototypes.
